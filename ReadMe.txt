Step 1: Assign current httpcontext to a variable.
Step 2: Change the server path of the context to a folder that is created within the solution.
Step 3: Initialize MultipartFormDataStreamProvider.
Step 4: Foreach file in Data Stream Provider get the filename.
Step 5: Trim the present in filename.
Step 6: Now combine the server path and filename into a path using Path.Combine(serverpath,filename).
Step 7: Move file to required path when uploaded.
Step 8: End for Step 9: Declare a model "question details" consisting the question number and difficulty of the question as properties.
Step 10: Get the data present in file into StreamReader.
Step 12: Now read the text line by line until it reaches end of page.

What makes our online exam system web project differs from others :
Low internet connection would be sufficient to load the pages, since we havenâ€™t used any picture data(using pictures the user with low internet connection takes time to load the images). In other online exam system websites , we can find only one admin who is surely responsible for the addition or deletion of the test, but we made this site any number of authorized persons can add/remove the examinations and these all authorized persons and users of this site will be controlled by the admin. It could be very helpful for educational institues acting as :
	Admin(headdash.php) --- director of institute
	Teacher(dash.php) --- professors of college
	User(acccount.php) --- students of the college
	home page (index.php) Security with password , even the admin cannot look at the password , ensuring the trust of the users. A feedback system available for suggesting improvements and registering complaints.

My Difficulties :

I have partially done my project on examination evaluation portal.
Where the output get from the project was about the difficulty of the questions where it given from input.
I am not familiar with web and app development.
In this project,I am done with a Visual Studio app which has a API development.
It was new for me, so I have more time to develop the full project.
And I am not sure the project was completed.
This project can use a one more application called POSTMAN Application.
And I develop with C Sharp i.e. C# , HTML and CSS.
